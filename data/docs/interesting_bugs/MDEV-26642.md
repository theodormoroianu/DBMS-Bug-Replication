# Bug MDEV-26642

## Description

### Isolation levels

| Isolation level    | Bug manifests |
|--------------------|---------------|
| `READ UNCOMMITTED` | No            |
| `READ COMMITTED`   | Yes           |
| `REPEATABLE READ`  | Yes           |
| `SERIALIZABLE`     | No            |

### Database and version

The bug manifests on the **_MariaDB_** DBMS.

The version of the database used for replicating the bug is `10.6.17`, and the bug was fixed in `10.6.18`, but the bug is also present in earlier versions of the DBMS, and other `10.x` and `11.x` versions.

## Bug explanation

The bug relies on concurent modifications of the same table.

A transaction updates a row of the table, the second transaction updates the entire table, but is then unable to read is own modification of the row updated b the first transaction.


The bug is similar to the following code:
```SQL
conn_0> begin;
conn_0> select * from t;                  -- [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]

conn_1> begin;
conn_1> update t set a = 10 where b = 1;
conn_1> commit;

conn_0> select * from t;                  -- [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]
conn_0> update t set a = 10 where true;
conn_0> select * from t;                  -- [(10, 0), (1, 1), (10, 2)]
conn_0> commit;
```

## Bug cause

This is a design issue of InnoDB.

The explanation for `REPEATABLE READ` is the following:
 * A transaction sees:
    - The rows created before the transaction was started (**_MariaDB_** advertises snapshot isolation as `REPEATABLE READ`).
    - The rows updated by the transaction itself.
 * In this testcase, the transaction does not update the (1, 10) record, so it does not see it.

I am not sure yet why the bug also manifests on `READ COMMITTED`.

## Bug fix

Fixed by [this PR](https://github.com/MariaDB/server/pull/3067).

## Isolation levels

The bug manifests on the `READ COMMITTED` and `REPEATABLE READ` isolation levels.

Under `READ UNCOMMITTED`, transactions are expected to have dirty reads.

Under `SERIALIZABLE`, ???.
