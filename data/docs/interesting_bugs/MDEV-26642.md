# Bug MDEV-26642

## Description

### Isolation levels

| Isolation level    | Bug manifests |
|--------------------|---------------|
| `READ UNCOMMITTED` | No            |
| `READ COMMITTED`   | Yes           |
| `REPEATABLE READ`  | Yes           |
| `SERIALIZABLE`     | No            |

### Database and version

The bug manifests on the **_MariaDB_** DBMS.

The version of the database used for replicating the bug is `10.6.17`, and the bug was fixed in `10.6.18`, but the bug is also present in earlier versions of the DBMS, and other `10.x` and `11.x` versions.

### Bug explanation

The bug relies on concurent modifications of the same table.

A transaction updates a row of the table, the second transaction updates the entire table, but is then unable to read is own modification of the row updated b the first transaction.


The bug is similar to the following code:
```SQL
conn_0> begin;
conn_0> select * from t;                  -- [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]

conn_1> begin;
conn_1> update t set a = 10 where b = 1;
conn_1> commit;

conn_0> select * from t;                  -- [(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2)]
conn_0> update t set a = 10 where true;
conn_0> select * from t;                  -- [(10, 0), (1, 1), (10, 2)]
conn_0> commit;
```

### Bug cause

For properly parsing **_Oracle_** SQL statements, a different parsing grammar is used. The standard grammar is defined in `sql/sql_yacc.yy`, and the Oracle grammar is defined in `sql/oracle_sql_yacc.yy`.

The later misses the following 2 lines:
```C++
if ($1->set_lock_to_the_last_select($3))
    MYSQL_YYABORT;
```

This 2 lines are the ones handling the low-level locking of the rows selected by the `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` statement.

### Bug fix

??

### Isolation levels

The bug manifests on the `READ COMMITTED` and `REPEATABLE READ` isolation levels.

Under `READ UNCOMMITTED`, transactions are expected to have dirty reads.

Under `SERIALIZABLE`, ???.
