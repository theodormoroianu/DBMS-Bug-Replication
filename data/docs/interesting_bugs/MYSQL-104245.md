# Bug MYSQL-104245

## Description

### Isolation levels

| Isolation level    | Bug manifests |
|--------------------|---------------|
| `READ UNCOMMITTED` | No            |
| `READ COMMITTED`   | Yes           |
| `REPEATABLE READ`  | Yes           |
| `SERIALIZABLE`     | No            |

### Database and version

The bug manifests on the **_MySQL_** DBMS.

The version of the database used for replicating the bug is `5.7.34`, and the bug cannot be replicated on `8.x` versions.

### Bug explanation

Inserting existing rows in transactions causes duplicate locks, which slow down the database. Other operations such as `REPLACE INTO` cause even more lock duplication.

### Bug cause

?

### Bug fix

The bug does not have a fix, as it does not appear in the `8.x` versions of the database.

### Isolation levels

The bug does not manifest in `READ UNCOMMITTED` and `SERIALIZABLE` isolation levels. Our intuition is the following:

 * `READ UNCOMMITTED`: The bug does not manifest because no locks are held on the rows, so no duplication can occur.
 * `SERIALIZABLE`: The bug does not manifest because locking mechanism is different ??
