### Database and version

The bug manifests on the **_MySQL_** DBMS.

The version of the database used for replicating the bug is `5.7.31`, but the bug is also present in other `5.x` versions.

### Bug explanation

When setting `query-cache-type=1`, the database fails to lock rows accessed by a serializable transaction.

### Bug cause

The bug is caused by a missing check when computing the isolation level of a transaction.

The check is specific to the `SERIALIZABLE` isolation level, which explains why the bug only occurs at that level.

### Bug fix

The bug issue is not closed, but the reporter added a possible fix in the comments.

The fix consists of adding missing checks specific to the `SERIALIZABLE` isolation level in the function verifying if data can be cached.

The bug only occurs at the `SERIALIZABLE` isolation level.
