# Bug TIDB-33315

## Description

### Isolation levels

| Isolation level    | Bug manifests |
|--------------------|---------------|
| `READ COMMITTED`   | No            |
| `REPEATABLE READ`  | Yes           |

### Database and version

The bug manifests on the **_TiDB_** DBMS, using its built-in, implicit storage engine.

The version of the database used for replicating the bug is `v5.4.0`.  The issue was closed without being resolved, but the bug is no longer reproducable on the latest release of **_TiDB_** as of August 2024.

## Bug explanation

A transaction deletes everything from a table, while a concurent transaction updates it.

The first transaction then sees data when running `SELECT * FROM t`, even though it has just deleted everything.

## Bug cause

The transaction updating the rows of the table is updating the primary key, which internally is treated as 2 separate operations:
 * Deleting the old row.
 * Inserting the new row.

As such, seeing the new rows from the other transaction consitutes a phantom read.

## Bug fix

The bug does not have a direct fix published.

## Isolation levels

The bug does not manifest at the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level, as committed transactions are visible by other transactions.

The bug manifests at the `REPEATABLE READ` isolation level, as the rows should not re-appear after being deleted.
