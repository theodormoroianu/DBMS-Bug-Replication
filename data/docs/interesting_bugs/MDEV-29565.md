## Description

### Isolation levels

| `REPEATABLE READ`  | Yes           |
| `SERIALIZABLE`     | No            |

### Database and version

The bug manifests on the **_MariaDB_** DBMS.

The version of the database used for replicating the bug is `10.8.3`, but the bug is also present in other `10.x` and `11.x` versions.

### Bug explanation

The bug causes some inconsistency in the database where `UPDATE` and `SELECT` see different data.

A simplified version of the bug is the following (no now initially has `a=63`):
```SQL
conn_0> START TRANSACTION;
conn_0> select * from t where <<CONDITION>>;      -- returns 1 record
conn_0> update t set a = 63 where <<CONDITION>>;
conn_0> select * from t where a = 63;             -- returns 2 records
conn_0> COMMIT;
```
