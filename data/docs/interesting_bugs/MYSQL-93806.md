# Bug MYSQL-93806

## Description

### Isolation levels

| Isolation level    | Bug manifests |
|--------------------|---------------|
| `READ UNCOMMITTED` | No            |
| `READ COMMITTED`   | Yes           |
| `REPEATABLE READ`  | Yes           |
| `SERIALIZABLE`     | No            |

### Database and version

The bug manifests on the **_MySQL_** DBMS.

The version of the database used for replicating the bug is `8.0.12`, and was fixed as part of the `8.0.16` release.

### Bug explanation

When the `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE` statement is used, a next-key lock is created instead of a record lock. This causes unnecessary locking on concurent tranactions.

### Bug cause

The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of next-key locks instead of record locks.

### Bug fix

This bug was fixed as part of [this release](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-16.html#mysqld-8-0-16-bug).

### Isolation levels

The bug only manifests on the `READ COMMITED` and `REPEATABLE READ` isolation level.

Our intuition is that:

 * On `READ UNCOMMITTED` the bug does not manifest because the transaction is not isolated from other transactions.
 * On `SERIALIZABLE` the bug does not manifest because the locking logic is different.
