# Bug TIDB-21498

## Description

### Isolation levels

| Isolation level    | Bug manifests |
|--------------------|---------------|
| `READ COMMITTED`   | Yes           |
| `REPEATABLE READ`  | No            |

### Database and version

The bug manifests on the **_TiDB_** DBMS, using the **_TiKV_** storage engine.

The version of the database used for replicating the bug does not have a release number, but is a **_Git_** commit (`3a32bd2df5`). The bug is not present in later releases of **_TiDB_**.

## Bug explanation

After dropping an index of a table, the index is no longer updated on table updates.

However, a transaction started before dropping the index still relies on it, and may fetch stale data.

## Bug cause

The bug is caused by a missing check for ensuring the used index is valid.

## Bug fix

The bug is fixed by [this PR](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/pull/22152).

## Isolation levels

The bug only manifests on the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level.
